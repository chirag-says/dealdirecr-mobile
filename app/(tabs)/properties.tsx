/**
 * Properties — browse, search and filter the whole corpus.
 *
 * Renamed from "Search" 2026-08-14. The old name described the ACT rather than
 * the destination, which is why it read oddly in the tab bar next to Home,
 * Saved and Profile: three nouns and a verb. It also undersold the screen —
 * arriving from Home's "View all" or the CTA banner lands here with no query
 * at all, browsing everything, which is not searching.
 *
 * Two modes on one screen, and the mode is explicit rather than inferred:
 *
 *   editing  — the field has focus and the suggestion panel is up.
 *   results  — the list is live.
 *
 * Inferring the mode from "is the field empty" is the usual shortcut and it
 * breaks the moment the user taps back into a field that already holds their
 * last query, wiping the results they were reading.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TAB OPENS ON RESULTS, NOT ON A PROMPT — fixed 2026-08-15
 *
 * Reported as "no properties are visible on the All filter", and it was worse
 * than that: on a fresh install this screen opened completely BLANK below the
 * search field. It started in `editing` with an empty field, which renders the
 * recent-searches panel, and that panel returns `null` when there are no
 * recent searches — which is every user's first visit.
 *
 * Two changes, and the second is the one that makes the class of bug go away:
 *
 *  1. The screen opens in results mode. `/properties/search` with no criteria
 *     returns the whole corpus, sorted and paginated, so "browse everything"
 *     is a real answer rather than the absence of one. A `browsing` flag used
 *     to carry that distinction; it is gone, because with no way to reach a
 *     criteria-less non-answer there is nothing left for it to distinguish.
 *  2. Editing mode only TAKES OVER the screen when it has something to put
 *     there. Focusing the field with nothing typed and no history now leaves
 *     the results in place instead of covering them with nothing.
 *
 * The old `StartPrompt` went with it. It existed to be shown when there was no
 * query to run, and there is no such state now.
 *
 * Typing still costs at most one debounced suggestions call, which matters
 * because both endpoints share a 20-request-per-minute limiter keyed on IP.

        THE QUICK-FILTER RAIL — 2026-08-14.

        This row used to be Filters plus three rent/sale chips, and every other
        facet was four taps deep behind Filters. It is now the pill rail the
        large portals run on their results pages; see `QuickFilterBar` for what
        was copied from which and why the three kinds of control on it look
        different.

        Still ONE row. The point of the earlier revision was that three stacked
        rows of chrome is most of a phone's viewport spent on how to look rather
        than on what there is, and adding six facets must not undo that — hence
        a rail that scrolls sideways rather than wraps.

        Filters left the rail on 2026-08-15 and now sits beside the search field
        above. It opens a surface rather than setting a value, so it belongs
        with the screen's other control, and moving it gave the rail back 93pt —
        enough that the segmented control and two facet pills are legible before
        anyone scrolls.
