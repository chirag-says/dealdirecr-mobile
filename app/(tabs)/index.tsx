/**
 * Home: discovery, not browsing.
 *
 *   Hero              white header, search, "Find Your Dream Home", Buy/Rent/Post
 *   Popular Listings  ranked by view count
 *   Builder Projects  newest builder developments
 *   Why DealDirect    the pitch, once, as three numbered lines
 *   Explore by City   live counts
 *   CTA
 *
 * Nothing here paginates and nothing here filters. Every affordance routes to
 * the one canonical results screen with a filter prefilled, so the app has a
 * single infinite scroll, a single filter sheet and a single sort.
 *
 * The whole tree is wrapped in `FontOverrideProvider`, which is what makes
 * every `Text` here — Hero's, Section's, the rail cards', CityGrid's — render
 * in DM Sans without each of those components knowing it. See `ui/Text.tsx`
 * for why the override lives there and not in a per-component prop.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DEFERRED MOUNTING
 *
 * `/properties/search` allows 20 requests per minute per IP, shared across
 * everyone behind a carrier NAT. Sections below the fold are wrapped in
 * `Reveal`, which withholds the MOUNT — and therefore the query — until the
 * section is within about a screen of the viewport. The hero is static and
 * paints before any request resolves, so the screen is never blank.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE COLLECTIONS ENGINE IS STILL HERE, JUST NOT RENDERED
 *
 * `features/home/collections.ts` holds fifteen curated rails (Luxury, Starter
 * Homes, Sea View and so on), each gated on live result counts. This layout
 * does not use them. They are one `COLLECTIONS.map()` away if the magazine
 * treatment is wanted later, and the registry costs nothing sitting idle.
