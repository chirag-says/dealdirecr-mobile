/**
 * The hero.
 *
 *   header      wordmark, messages, notifications, profile
 *   headline    "Find your / dream home"
 *   artwork     the house cutout, full width
 *   search card white, elevated, OVERLAPPING the artwork
 *     └ search row + Buy/Rent segment + Post Property
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE ARTWORK IS A FULL-WIDTH BAND AND NOT A RIGHT-HAND PANEL
 *
 * The design this is built from puts a rectangular photograph on the right of
 * the headline, bleeding off the screen edge with its left corners rounded.
 * That composition needs a photo with a background — you crop it and whatever
 * is left still reads as a picture.
 *
 * The supplied artwork is a Photoroom cutout: a house on an oval of lawn, on
 * TRANSPARENCY, 1672x941. It has a silhouette rather than edges. Cropping it
 * into a tall right-hand panel would cut the house in half and leave the lawn
 * hanging in space, and a cutout cannot "bleed off" an edge it does not have.
 *
 * So the artwork is set narrower than the screen and pushed to the right, on
 * white, which is what a background-free cutout is FOR. It sits opposite the
 * headline rather than under it, the search card rides up over its lower edge,
 * and the house is shown whole.
 *
 * `contentFit="contain"` rather than `cover`, for the same reason: the
 * transparent margin around the house is part of the composition, and cropping
 * to fill would clip the roof.
 */

/** 1672x941 as supplied. Declared so the band reserves the right height
 *  before the image decodes and nothing below it jumps on first paint. */
const ARTWORK_RATIO = 1672 / 941;

/**
 * Narrower than the screen and anchored right, which is as close to the
 * reference's right-hand placement as a cutout can honestly get: the artwork
 * sits opposite the headline rather than under the middle of it, and the empty
 * left margin becomes deliberate white space instead of dead centre padding.
 */
const ARTWORK_WIDTH = '95%';

/**
 * Bleeds the artwork past the right gutter so it reads as anchored to the
 * screen edge rather than floating just inside it. Pushed further than the
 * first pass — the cutout's right edge is mostly tree canopy and fence rail,
 * which crops gracefully, unlike the roofline on the left.
 */

/**
 * Closes the transparent margin above the house.
 *
 * The PNG carries roughly a fifth of its height as empty space over the roof.
 * `contain` honours that, so without this the headline and the artwork are
 * separated by a gap nobody chose and which is invisible in the source file.

        "Buy, Rent & Sell Properties" is 27 characters against roughly 350pt of
        usable width once the screen gutters are taken out. At 34pt it measures
        near 500pt and wraps to two lines, and the accent line wraps to two
        more — a four-line headline that pushes the artwork and the search
        field most of a screen further down, which is the opposite of what this
        hero is for. At 28pt the same copy settles in three lines and the
        search card stays in the first viewport.

        The break before the accent line is explicit rather than left to the
        wrap. Where the colour changes is a meaning boundary — what you can do,
        then who you do it with — and letting the line box decide would put
