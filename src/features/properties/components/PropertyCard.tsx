/**
 * Property card.
 *
 * Design decisions, and why each one is not the obvious default:
 *
 * **No card container.** The first version wrapped this in a bordered, shadowed
 * surface. On a white background that is a white box on white, so the border
 * outlined the photo and the shadow did nothing except add noise. The photo is
 * already a solid block of colour with a hard edge; it defines the card by
 * itself. Separation between cards is carried by space, which is the cheapest
 * rung of the hierarchy ladder and the one to try before a border or a shadow.
 *
 * **One focal point.** Price is the field a buyer scans a feed by, so it takes
 * `title2` and nothing else on the card comes near that weight. The previous
 * version set price at 18/600 and the title at 16/600, which blurs into two
 * identical grey bars with nowhere for the eye to land.
 *
 * **Three groups, not five stacked lines.** Price, then place, then facts, with
 * a real gap between groups and tight spacing inside them. Every line
 * previously sat 4px from its neighbour, which reads as one undifferentiated
 * block regardless of what the words say.
 *
 * **The title is usually absent.** It is machine-composed from the same fields
 * rendered below it. See `isGeneratedTitle` in the adapter.
 *
 * Memoised, with a `useCallback` press handler, because this renders once per
 * row and an allocation here is multiplied by scroll distance.
