/**
 * The photo carousel at the top of a listing.
 *
 * Full-bleed and running under the status bar, so the screen that hosts it
 * must not reserve a top inset.
 *
 * Chrome is dark-translucent rather than surface-coloured. A pale control
 * disappears against a bright sky and a dark one disappears against a shadowed
 * wall, so neither scheme's surface colour is legible over an arbitrary
 * photograph. Dark with white content works over every image, which is the
 * only requirement here. Same reasoning as the intent chip on `PropertyCard`.
 *
 * The `hero` scrim is the right variant rather than the card default: it
 * darkens the top as well as the bottom, which keeps the nav controls legible
 * over a bright sky, where the card variant holds near-zero for its whole
 * upper half.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE BACK BUTTON IS NOT HERE ANY MORE
 *
 * It used to be, floated over the photo, and it went off the top of the screen
 * with the photo. On a listing with four attribute sections and an EMI
 * calculator that is several thousand pixels with no way back, which is the
 * one control a detail screen may never lose. It now belongs to
 * `DetailHeader`, which stays put and changes appearance as the photo leaves.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PARALLAX AND STRETCH
 *
 * `scrollY` is the host scroll view's offset, shared from the UI thread. Two
 * behaviours come off it, and both are the physical reading of the same fact:
 * the photo sits BEHIND the content rather than being the first item in it.
 *
 *   scrolling up   the photo drifts at a fraction of the content's speed, so
 *                  the sheet of content reads as sliding over it
 *   pulling down   the photo is pinned to the top edge and scales from its top
 *                  origin, so it grows into the slack instead of leaving a
 *                  band of background above it
 *
 * The content block below is opaque and paints after this one, so the grown
 * photo passes underneath it and needs no clipping container. A container with
 * `overflow: hidden` would clip away the stretch that is the whole point.
 *
 * Under reduced motion both are dropped. Parallax is textbook vestibular
 * motion, and unlike a press there is nothing here that needs acknowledging —
 * the scroll itself is the feedback.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY A PAGED FlatList AND NOT A MAPPED ScrollView
 *
 * Listings carry up to 65 images (15 flat plus 50 categorised). A ScrollView
 * mounts every child immediately, so opening a well-photographed listing would
 * decode sixty-odd full-width images before the first paint. The FlatList
 * renders a window of three and recycles, which is the difference between a
 * carousel that opens instantly and one that stutters for a second first.
 *
 * Page position is read from `onMomentumScrollEnd` rather than from
 * `onViewableItemsChanged`. The viewability callback fires mid-swipe against a
 * configurable threshold and produces a counter that flickers to the next
 * number before the page has actually settled; momentum end fires once, after
 * the page has landed, which is exactly when the counter should change.
