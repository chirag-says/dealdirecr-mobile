/**
 * Search filter state, and its projection onto the backend's query params.
 *
 * Every field here maps to a param `searchProperties` reads AND that live data
 * actually responds to. Both halves were checked; the second half is where most
 * of this file's reasoning went, because several params the controller accepts
 * do nothing useful against the production database.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT `/properties/search` ACCEPTS
 * (backend/controllers/propertyController.js:1811, read 2026-08-03; every claim
 * below was then probed against https://backend.dealdirect.in on the same day,
 * against a corpus of 36 approved listings.)
 *
 *   search        regex over title, description, address.city, address.area,
 *                 address.locality. Case-insensitive, escaped server-side.
 *                 VERIFIED: "Apartment" → 16, "Showroom" → 2, "Bengaluru" → 6.
 *                 SHIPPED.
 *
 *   priceFrom     price >= n, on the raw `price` column, in rupees.
 *   priceTo       price <= n.
 *                 VERIFIED: priceTo=100000 → 21, priceFrom=5000000 → 8, against
 *                 a baseline of 36. Consistent with `price` holding rupees.
 *                 SHIPPED, as bands — see PRICE below.
 *
 *   sort          newest | priceAsc | priceDesc. SHIPPED.
 *   page, limit   offset paging, limit defaults to 12. SHIPPED.
 *
 *   category      exact ObjectId match. NOT SHIPPED — see TAXONOMY below.
 *   subcategory   exact ObjectId match. NOT SHIPPED — same reason.
 *   propertyType  exact ObjectId match. NOT SHIPPED — same reason.
 *   city          exact, CASE-SENSITIVE match on `address.city`.
 *                 NOT SHIPPED — see CITY below.
 *   buildingType  NOT SHIPPED — the field does not exist on the schema.
 *   size          NOT SHIPPED — the field does not exist on the schema.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TAXONOMY, CITY, FURNISHING, CONSTRUCTION STATUS — updated 2026-08-08.
 *
 * The reasoning above (category/property-type params being unusable, city
 * being exact-and-case-sensitive) is still true of the SERVER-SIDE `category`,
 * `subcategory`, `propertyType` and `city` query params. None of that changed.
 *
 * What changed is where the filtering happens. `usePopularListings`
 * (`features/home/usePopularListings.ts`) already established the accepted
 * pattern for this exact situation: fetch one bounded page from the paginated
 * `/properties/search` endpoint (`limit=100`, never the unbounded
 * `/property-list` or `/filter` — see `MOBILE_APP_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §7
 * rule 18) and do the real filtering client-side over rows already in hand.
 * The live corpus is 36 listings (§5.5 of `docs/HANDOFF.md`), so one page of
 * 100 covers all of it today, same ceiling `usePopularListings` documents.
 *
 * That pattern resolves the taxonomy problem outright: `categoryName` is the
 * denormalised STRING field, confirmed correct on every row in the original
 * audit. The corruption was only ever in the `category`/`propertyType`
 * ObjectId REFS, which a client-side string match never touches. So a
 * Residential/Commercial filter is safe to offer now — see `CATEGORY_OPTIONS`
 * and `matchesCategory` below.
 *
 * City gets the same treatment, reusing the alias table `features/home/
 * cities.ts` already built for the "Explore by City" tile counts, for the
 * identical reason: `address.city` still has "Bangalore"/"Bengaluru",
 * "Kolkata"/"kolkata" duplicates in production, and a raw equality match would
 * still under-return. `matchCity` merges those before comparing, so the filter
 * behaves the way a user expects a "Bangalore" filter to behave. See
 * `CITY_OPTIONS` and `matchesCity`.
 *
 * `furnishing` turned out to be a real schema field (`Property.furnishing`,
 * `String`) with a real fixed set of values — the add/edit listing form
 * (`features/listings/components/ListingForm.tsx:417`) writes exactly
 * `Unfurnished` / `Semi-furnished` / `Fully furnished` and nothing else. Not
 * the field the website's own broken filter reads (it checks the nonexistent
 * `furnishingStatus`), but the real one. Exact match is safe here because the
 * value set is closed by the form that writes it.
 *
 * `constructionStatus` is real but free text (no enum), typed by an owner
 * against a placeholder suggestion ("Ready to move / Under construction") in
 * the same form. An exact match against free text would fail the same way the
 * website's own broken filters do, so this one is a best-effort keyword match
 * (`matchesConstructionStatus`), not an equality check — documented as such so
 * nobody mistakes it for a closed enum later.
 *
 * None of this required a `/properties/search` param that does not exist, and
 * none of it calls an unbounded endpoint. It is the same rule the earlier
 * version of this comment established, applied with one more year of
 * hindsight: filter on data proven correct, over rows already fetched.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PRICE: bands, not a slider.
 *
 * `price` holds rupees, and `priceUnit` does NOT scale it — it carries the
 * schema default "Lac" on most rows regardless of the value beside it. The full
 * evidence is in `src/ui/PriceLabel.tsx`; the filter and the label agree on
 * this, which is the point.
 *
 * Bands rather than a range slider because one linear axis has to cover both
 * ₹8,000 rentals and ₹5 crore sales — a slider makes the entire rental range
 * about one pixel wide. The backend has no `listingType` param to split the two
 * populations, so the axis cannot be scoped. `RangeSlider` stays unused until
 * it can be.
 *
 * Bands are inclusive at both ends server-side (`$gte` / `$lte`), so a listing
 * priced exactly on a boundary appears in both adjacent bands. Only one band is
 * selectable at a time, so no user sees the duplicate.
