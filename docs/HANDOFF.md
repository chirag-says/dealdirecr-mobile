# Mobile app — handoff

Written 2026-08-05, updated 2026-08-07 (M7-M9), updated 2026-08-07 (M11-M13,
M10 skipped for now), updated 2026-08-08 (M15-M22 scoped from a feature-parity
audit against the website, same day M15–M17 were implemented — see §8).
Point a new session at this file first, then
[`../README.md`](../README.md) and [`API_CONTRACT.md`](API_CONTRACT.md).

The plan of record is [`../../MOBILE_APP_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md`](../../MOBILE_APP_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md),
which defines milestones M0–M14. This file says where we actually are against
it. **M15–M22 (below, §8) are not in that document** — they were scoped
2026-08-08 from a direct website-vs-mobile feature audit and extend the plan
rather than amend it. Treat §8 as the plan of record for that range until it
is folded into the architecture doc. **M15, M16 and M17 are done** (M16/M17
each minus one map-related item still blocked on the M4 dev-client rebuild,
§5.1); M18–M22 remain scope only.

## 1. Status in one table

| Milestone | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Contract lock, tokens, toolchain | **done** |
| M1 | App shell, navigation, design system | **done** |
| M2 | Transport + authentication | **done** |
| M3 | Property discovery (search, filters, infinite scroll) | **done** |
| M4 | Property detail, gallery, map | **detail, gallery, attributes done. Map held** (§2.5) |
| M5 | Favorites, saved searches, notifications | **done** (§2.6) |
| M6 | Chat | **done** (§2.7) |
| M7 | Profile, settings, rewards | **done** (§2.9) |
| M8 | Owner mode: listings and uploads | **done** (§2.10) |
| M9 | Leads and analytics | **done** (§2.11) |
| M10 | Agreements | **withdrawn from the product**, not merely skipped — see audit §4.2 |
| M11 | Projects, units, campaigns, bookings | **done** (§2.12) |
| M12 | Deep linking, offline, performance | **core pieces done** (§2.13) |
| M13 | Push notifications | **client-side/local done, server push still blocked** (§2.14) |
| M14 | Store readiness and release | not started |

**Working screens today:** Home, Search, property detail + gallery, Saved
(interested list + saved searches), Messages (list + thread), notifications,
the four auth screens, the tab shell, profile/settings/rewards, the full
owner surface (my listing, add/edit, leads, analytics), and the full projects
vertical (list, detail, unit types, group-buy campaigns, bookings, my
bookings). The property detail locator map and M14 are still `Placeholder`
stubs. **M10 (agreements) is the only milestone in M4–M13 not started.**
Corrected 2026-08-09: it is not merely "skipped by instruction." The backend
mount `app.use("/api/agreements", agreementRoutes)` is **commented out** in this
working tree (`backend/server.js:869`) under a comment recording a client
decision on 2026-08-01 to withdraw the agreement generator, alongside the
website's own `agreements/page.js` returning 404 and three navbar links removed.
It is still mounted on `origin/main`, i.e. live in production today, so the next
deploy is what closes it. Building a mobile client for it would ship a feature
the website deliberately hides. See audit §4.2.

## 2. What exists in the codebase right now

### 2.1 Foundation (M0–M2, complete and stable)

- `src/api/` — typed endpoint registry (`endpoints/_contract.ts` + one file per
  domain), axios client, error normalisation, TanStack Query setup, query keys.
  **Every backend route the app will ever call is already typed here.** Wiring a
  feature means writing a hook, not discovering an API.
- `src/auth/` — `AuthProvider`, cookie capture/restore via
  `@react-native-cookies/cookies` + SecureStore, zod schemas for every auth form.
- `src/theme/` — colors (semantic roles, light/dark), typography, spacing/radius/
  elevation, motion (springs, not durations), scrim gradients.
- `src/ui/` — 22 primitives. Screen, Text, Button, Input, Select, Sheet, Card,
  Badge, Avatar, Image, Skeleton, EmptyState, ErrorState, Chip, PriceLabel,
  RangeSlider, plus four Home-era additions (§2.8).
- `src/storage/` — three MMKV instances (cache / prefs / drafts) with a
  logout-scoped clear that deliberately spares preferences.

### 2.2 Property discovery (M3, complete)

- `features/properties/` — `adapters.ts` (80-field backend model → flat
  `PropertySummary`), `api.ts`, `hooks.ts` (`usePropertyFeed`, infinite +
  deduped), `PropertyCard`, `PropertyList`, `PropertyStrip`.
- `features/search/` — `filters.ts` (verified param mapping, price bands),
  `SearchBar`, `FilterSheet`, `SuggestionList`, MMKV recent searches.

### 2.3 Builder projects (early M11, new this session)

`src/features/projects/` is a **complete data layer** for the project list:

- `types.ts` — `ProjectSummary`
- `adapters.ts` — `adaptProject`, cover-image fallback chain, builder narrowing
- `api.ts` — `fetchProjects` against `GET /projects` (same call the website makes)
- `hooks.ts` — `useRecentProjects`
- `components/ProjectCard.tsx`, `components/ProjectRail.tsx`

**Not done for M11:** project detail, unit types, floor plans, group-buy
campaigns (join/exit + the 10-per-15-min limiter), bookings, payment-proof
upload. All five `app/projects/*` screens are still stubs.

### 2.5 Property detail (M4, done except the map)

`app/property/[id]/index.tsx` and `app/property/[id]/gallery.tsx`, built on
`features/properties/`:

- `types.ts` / `adapters.ts` — `PropertyDetail` extends `PropertySummary`
  rather than mirroring the ~80 backend fields; it carries `raw: Property` for
  the field map to read declaratively (below), and lifts only what needs real
  decisions: gallery flattening, owner contact, address lines.
- `fieldMap.ts` + `DetailAttributes.tsx` — the declarative attribute table, 8
  sections / ~60 fields. **Presence decides what renders, not `categoryName`**:
  the taxonomy refs are corrupt (§3.4), so a mislabelled listing would render
  the wrong half of its data if category picked the field set. A section with
  no fillable rows disappears rather than rendering empty.
- `DetailHero.tsx` — paged `FlatList` carousel (not a mapped `ScrollView`: a
  listing can carry up to 65 images across `images[]` and every
  `categorizedImages` bucket), tapping through to `gallery.tsx`'s full-screen
  pinch-zoom viewer (`ZoomableImage.tsx`). The gallery route reads through the
  same cached query the detail screen already populated, so opening it costs
  no extra request and — this is the one that matters — no extra view count.
- `hooks.ts`'s `usePropertyDetail` disables every automatic refetch
  (`staleTime: Infinity`, `refetchOnMount/Reconnect: false`) because
  `GET /properties/:id` **increments `views` on every call**. `refresh()`
  stays available for a deliberate pull.
- `interest.ts` + `DetailActions.tsx` — see §3.2. No heart icon; a labelled
  button with a consequence line, optimistic with rollback, surfaces the
  backend's own 400 message (five-listing cap, own listing, already marked)
  rather than trying to predict it client-side.
- `ReportSheet.tsx` — preset reasons that satisfy the backend's 10-character
  minimum, editable.

**Redesigned 2026-08-09**, structure only — no data, query or endpoint changed:

- `DetailHeader.tsx` (new) — the nav bar. The back button used to live in the
  hero and scroll away with it, leaving a several-thousand-pixel page with no
  way out. It now stays, cross-fading from a dark disc over the photo to an
  opaque bar carrying the listing's location, driven by the scroll offset as a
  shared value. It also owns the status-bar style flip, which is the one part
  of the transition that is discrete rather than continuous. **Opaque, not
  blurred** — `expo-blur` is a native module and `ui/Gradient.tsx` explains what
  adding one costs; the collapsed bar is what iOS itself falls back to under
  Reduce Transparency.
- `DetailHero.tsx` — parallax on scroll, top-anchored stretch on overscroll,
  both off under Reduce Motion. The content block below is opaque and paints
  after it, which is what lets the photo grow underneath without a clipping
  container.
- `ExpandableText.tsx` (new) — descriptions clamp to six lines. Line count is
  measured with a hidden unclamped copy because `onTextLayout` on a clamped
  `Text` does not report the same thing on both platforms.
- Surfaces (`DetailFacts`, `DetailAttributes`, `DetailOwner`) dropped their
  outlines for `Card bordered={false} radius="xl"` plus hairline separators
  inset from the row's leading edge. The page background sits one step down the
  neutral ramp from `surface` precisely so this works — see `theme/colors.ts`.
- `DetailActions.tsx` lost Share (now in the nav bar) and Report (now a quiet
  footer link, after the thing it refers to). Four equal-weight icons beside the
  primary button read as a toolbar of options rather than as one decision. The
  bar reports its own height so the scroll content ends clear of it instead of
  guessing at a constant.
- `ui/Tag.tsx` (new) — amenities and nearby places were rendered with `Chip`,
  which is a `Pressable` with `accessibilityRole="button"`, so VoiceOver
  announced twenty dead controls per listing. `Tag` is the same visual family
  with no role. `Card` gained `bordered` and `radius`; both default to the old
  behaviour, so no other call site moved.

**Unverified on device.** Typecheck and lint pass; the parallax, the header
cross-fade and the expand animation have not been run on hardware.

**Not done:** the locator map (§1.17, C1). Held for a dev-client rebuild —
`react-native-webview` and `expo-location` are native modules, and Chirag's
device workflow runs on `expo start --tunnel`, which ships JS only (§5.1).
Chirag confirmed "keep the locator" for C1 when asked.

**Untested on a device:** the gallery's pinch/pan gesture handoff (pan is
disabled while at rest so the carousel can still page beneath it; enabled once
zoomed) and the property detail action bar's layout. Both are reasoned
through, not observed running.

### 2.6 Saved, saved searches, and notifications (M5, done)

`features/saved/`, `features/savedSearches/`, `features/notifications/`;
`app/(tabs)/saved.tsx`, `app/notifications.tsx`.

- **Saved is "Interested," not "Favourites."** See §3.2 — one backend list,
  two names. The tab's first segment is labelled Interested; the count line
  ("3 of 5 used") is functional, since the cap makes this screen where a user
  comes to make room, not decoration.
- **Saved searches only expose city, price band, and rent/sale.** The alert
  matcher (`propertyController.js:484`) reads five stored filter fields but
  only three actually match anything, and `availableFor` silently misses every
  "Sell"-spelled listing when saved as "sale" (§3.4's spelling problem, a
  second time). Offering a control that quietly fails half the time is worse
  than not offering it. `isInert` on a saved search (no filter the matcher
  reads) disables its alert switch and says why, rather than promising alerts
  that can never fire.
- **The backend's `isActive` toggle is deliberately wired to nothing.**
  `GET /saved-searches/mine` filters to `isActive: true`, so flipping a search
  off would drop it from the only endpoint that can ever list it again — a
  delete with extra steps. `PUT .../notifyEmail|notifyInApp` is the reversible
  control actually exposed.
- **Notifications badge is counted from the list**, not from
  `GET /notifications/unread-count` — no such endpoint exists; `unreadCount`
  is summed client-side from the same rows the screen renders, capped at
  "99+" since the list itself is hard-capped at the 100 most recent. Read
  routes are PATCH (`/notifications/:id/read`, `/notifications/mark-all/read`)
  — the website's own helper calls PUT paths that 404.

`src/lib/htmlEntities.ts` — extracted here because chat (§2.7) needed the
identical decode a second time: two backend code paths (`express-validator`'s
`.escape()` on saved-search names, `chatController`'s hand-rolled `escapeHtml`
on message text) both produce the same five HTML entities.

### 2.7 Chat (M6, done)

`src/socket/` (the transport) and `features/chat/`; `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`,
`app/chat/[conversationId].tsx`. `socket.io-client@4.8.3` added — pure JS, no
native module, so this did **not** need a dev-client rebuild.

- **`socketManager.ts` is a plain module, not a hook or context value** — one
  socket for the whole app, matching architecture plan §1.8. `SocketProvider`
  (mounted in `app/_layout.tsx`, inside `AuthProvider`) only drives lifecycle:
  connect on `authenticated` + foreground, disconnect on `guest` + background.
  Every screen reads the connection through `useSocketStatus` /
  `useOnlineUserIds` / `useIsUserOnline`, which work with no provider present.
- **The handshake re-runs on every `connect`, not just the first one.** The
  socket JWT (`GET /chat/socket-token`) lives 5 minutes, so caching it across a
  background/foreground cycle would mean authenticating with an almost-certainly-
  expired token. Socket.IO's own reconnection (capped exponential backoff) is
  left on for transport drops; the app-level handshake hooks into its
  `connect` event every time, first or reconnect alike.
- **`auth_error` gets exactly one retry, then a session failure** — per the
  plan's "do not retry blindly." A second consecutive failure calls
  `socket.disconnect()` (which also halts Socket.IO's own reconnect loop) and
  hands off to `refreshUser()`, the only way to learn whether the real session
  cookie is still good.
- **`useMessageThread` merges three sources into one list**: REST history
  (`GET /chat/messages/:id`, paginated OLDER by increasing page number, each
  page oldest-first internally — assembling one oldest-first list means
  reversing PAGE order, not item order), a live tail from `receive_message`
  scoped by room membership, and this device's own optimistic sends. Send is
  REST-then-emit exactly per the plan: persist first, then fan out the
  server's own saved object over the socket — never the other way around.
- **`visit_request` / `visit_confirmation` render as a distinct card**, not a
  bubble with a button bolted on (the website's actual treatment). The Accept
  action also tracks whether a later `visit_confirmation` already exists in
  the thread and hides itself once one does — the website's own `canAcceptVisit`
  has no such memory and would offer Accept on the same request forever.
- **Property detail's "Message owner" now calls `useStartConversation`**,
  wired into `DetailActions.tsx` from §2.5, closing the loop the plan
  describes ("M4 for entry from property detail").
- **Corrected in `types/backend/chat.ts`:** `StartConversationRequest`
  declared `ownerId` as required; the controller never reads it (derives the
  owner from the property, by explicit design, to prevent IDOR) — dropped.

**Flagged, not fixed:** `send_message`, `typing`, and `stop_typing` on the
backend trust client-supplied identity fields (`data.message.sender`,
`data.userId`) instead of verifying them against the authenticated socket,
unlike `join_conversation`, which does check DB participation. Blast radius is
limited to conversations an attacker is already a genuine participant in, but
within that room they could forge a message appearing to come from the other
participant. This app only ever emits its own REST-validated data, so it isn't
exploitable from here — it's a backend hardening item, spun off separately
rather than fixed in this session.

**Untested on a device:** the whole feature. Socket lifecycle across a real
background/foreground cycle, the inverted `FlatList`'s footer-is-visually-top
behaviour, and the keyboard-avoidance offset (`HEADER_HEIGHT` in the thread
screen is a measured estimate) all need verification on a physical device
before this is called solid.

### 2.8 Home screen + design system

New UI primitives, all generic and reusable:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/ui/Gradient.tsx` | Linear gradients via RN's `experimental_backgroundImage`. **No native module** — deliberately, see §5.1 |
| `src/ui/Scrim.tsx` | Gradient overlay for text on photos |
| `src/ui/PressableScale.tsx` | Press feedback as scale, not opacity |
| `src/ui/Rail.tsx` | The one horizontal scroller: peek, snap, gutters |
| `src/lib/scrollReveal.tsx` | Deferred mounting — the rate-limit mechanism, §5.2 |

Home feature (`src/features/home/`):

- `Hero.tsx` — full-bleed photo, colour-graded scrim, search trigger, Buy/Rent/Post
- `usePopularListings.ts` — ranks by `views`, client-side (§3.3)
- `cities.ts` + `useCityCounts.ts` — 12 city tiles, **live counts**, spelling
  variants merged client-side (§3.5)
- `CityGrid.tsx`, `AboutDealDirect.tsx`, `CtaBanner.tsx`
- `collections.ts` + `useCollection.ts` + `CollectionRail.tsx` — **built, tested,
  and NOT currently rendered.** A registry of 15 curated rails (Luxury, Starter
  Homes, Sea View…), each gated on live result count so a rail that cannot fill
  itself renders nothing. One `COLLECTIONS.map()` away from being live. Do not
  delete it without asking.

`features/properties/recentlyViewed.ts` — MMKV history, snapshots the card
fields rather than storing ids, **because refetching would inflate the backend's
view counter** (the same counter Popular Listings ranks on).

Current Home order: Hero → Popular Listings → Builder Projects → Why DealDirect
→ Explore by City → CTA.

### 2.9 Profile, settings, rewards (M7, done)

`features/profile/`, `features/rewards/`; `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`,
`app/settings/*`, `app/rewards/index.tsx`.

- **No `useProfile` query.** `AuthProvider` already holds the current user
  from its cold-start `GET /users/me` probe; every mutation here calls
  `refreshUser()` on success instead of maintaining a second cache of the same
  document.
- **Edit profile lives inline on the Settings screen**, not on its own route.
  No such route was scaffolded in M0, the form is four fields (name, phone,
  bio, photo) plus an email-notifications toggle, and a save button that is
  visibly dirty-or-not reads better than a navigation round trip for that.
  `preferences` goes over as a JSON string field on the same multipart
  request — `updateProfile` (userController.js:922) reads it that way; it is
  not in the `updateProfile` endpoint's doc comment because that comment only
  covers the file field.
- **The owner-upgrade OTP flow is a `Sheet`, not a route**, opened from the
  buyer/user role's card on the Profile tab. Two-step (`send-upgrade-otp` /
  `verify-upgrade-otp`), gated client-side on `user.isVerified` since the
  backend's `requireVerified` would 400 first anyway — this just saves the
  round trip.
- **`transactions` and `referrals` are read defensively.** Both controllers
  spread a service result directly into the envelope (see
  `types/backend/rewards.ts`), so the exact key names were not confirmed
  against a live response this session. The hooks try the plausible key names
  and fall back to an empty list/zero rather than crash if the real key
  differs — pin this down against production data before trusting the
  Activity section's completeness.
- **`referralLink` is shared as-is**, never rewritten into a deep link — it
  points at the website by backend design (built from `CLIENT_URL`), and
  rewriting it would break attribution for a recipient without the app.
- **Delete account requires typing `DELETE`** rather than a single
  confirmation tap, given App Store policy requires this screen exist at all
  but says nothing about how easy reaching it should be.

### 2.10 Owner mode: listings and uploads (M8, done)

`features/listings/`; `app/owner/properties.tsx`,
`app/owner/property/new.tsx`, `app/owner/property/[id]/edit.tsx`.

Added `expo-image-picker` and `expo-image-manipulator` — both native modules,
so **this milestone also needs the dev-client rebuild** already pending for
the M4 map (§5.1). Neither works in the JS-only `--tunnel` bundle.

- **`add` and `edit` are NOT the same contract.** `POST /properties/add`
  sanitises through a strict field-name whitelist
  (`PROPERTY_ALLOWED_FIELDS`, propertyController.js:42) before
  `Property.create`; `PUT /properties/my-properties/:id`
  (`updateMyProperty`, propertyController.js:1258) has **no whitelist at
  all** and writes whatever reaches `req.body` through Mongoose schema
  binding directly. `src/features/listings/formData.ts` has the full
  field-by-field reasoning; the short version is two separate builders,
  `buildAddFormData` and `buildEditFormData`, and they are not
  interchangeable.
- **Several whitelist entries do not correspond to any real schema path** —
  `floor` (schema: `floorNo`), `age`/`availability` (schema has neither),
  flat `builtUpArea`/`carpetArea`/etc. (schema wants them nested under
  `area`), `parkingCovered`/`parkingOpen` as flats (schema wants `parking`
  nested). Mongoose's default strict mode drops these silently — no error,
  no save. The form only offers fields that are confirmed to reach the
  document: the intersection of the whitelist and
  `backend/models/Property.js`, not the whitelist alone.
- **Editing `address.line`/`state`/`pincode` is not possible through this
  backend.** `updateMyProperty` unconditionally rebuilds `data.address` from
  flat top-level `city`/`locality`/`landmark`/`latitude`/`longitude` and
  stuffs anything sent as a nested `address` object into a non-schema
  `address.full` string. This is a server limitation, not a client one — the
  edit form does not offer those three fields, and does not silently drop a
  user's edit to them because it never asks.
- **Edit-flow images are a real landmine, handled, not just documented.**
  `updateMyProperty` rebuilds `categorizedImages` from
  `existingCategorizedImages` (JSON) plus any newly uploaded files on *every*
  call, then rebuilds the flat `images` array from that. Omitting
  `existingCategorizedImages` reads to the controller as "this listing now
  has zero photos" and wipes the gallery. `buildEditFormData` always sends
  the full current photo set back under that key. This app has no per-room
  categorisation UI, so every photo — existing or newly added — lives in a
  single `other` bucket key within whichever of `residential`/`commercial`
  the listing's `categoryName` selects.
- **An owner account is capped at one listing, server-side** (the atomic
  check-and-create in `addProperty`). `useMyProperties` is written against
  the list response anyway so a future cap relaxation needs no client change,
  but `app/owner/properties.tsx` in practice renders zero or one card.
- **Edit reads from `useMyProperties`, never `GET /properties/:id`** — that
  endpoint increments the view counter on every call (§2.5), and an owner
  opening their own listing to edit it should not count as a view. An owner
  has at most one listing, so searching the cached list by id is cheap.
- **Draft autosave is add-only.** `draftStorage` (MMKV, pre-provisioned in M0
  for exactly this) writes on every field change; a resumed draft is offered
  once on mount via a confirm dialog rather than silently applied, so a stale
  abandoned draft cannot clobber a fresh start. Editing an existing listing
  has no local-only state worth protecting the same way.
- **Client-side compression, not just a picker.** `expo-image-manipulator`
  resizes to a 1600px long edge and re-encodes at JPEG quality 0.7 before
  upload — the backend's 10 MB per-file cap is easy to exceed with an
  uncompressed modern camera photo, especially with several picked at once.
- **Only a flat photo gallery is offered**, not the backend's per-room
  categorisation (`categorizedImages.residential.kitchen`, etc.). Building
  that UI was out of scope for this pass; see the image-landmine note above
  for why "no categorisation UI" and "images survive an edit" are not in
  tension.
- **Category and property type are closed choices** (`Residential` /
  `Commercial`, and a fixed list per category in `features/listings/types.ts`)
  rather than free text or the corrupt taxonomy refs (§3.4). `categoryName`
  and `propertyTypeName` are stored as denormalised strings on the schema
  either way, so this loses nothing the backend would have used.

### 2.11 Leads and analytics (M9, done)

`features/leads/`; `app/owner/leads/index.tsx`, `app/owner/leads/[id].tsx`,
`app/owner/analytics.tsx`.

- **Lead detail has no endpoint of its own.** `GET /leads` (paginated) is the
  only read path; the detail screen finds its lead in the same infinite-query
  cache the list screen already populated rather than issuing a second
  request the backend cannot serve.
- **`stats` (on `GET /leads`) and the shape from `GET /leads/analytics` are
  two different, unrelated objects** — the list's stats block is
  `{new,contacted,...,total,today}` from `leadController.js:484`, typed
  locally in `app/owner/leads/index.tsx` since the shared contract types it
  as `unknown`; the analytics screen uses the separately-typed
  `LeadAnalyticsResponse`. Do not assume one can stand in for the other.
- **No chart library was added.** The mobile app has none installed, and five
  summary numbers plus a status breakdown did not justify a new dependency —
  `app/owner/analytics.tsx`'s bars are plain `View`s sized by proportion.
- **Marking a lead viewed happens on open**, once, guarded by `lead.isViewed`
  so revisiting an already-read lead does not re-fire the mutation.

### 2.12 Projects, units, campaigns, bookings (M11, done)

`features/projects/*` (extended: `projectDetail.ts`, `campaigns.ts`,
`bookings.ts`, `components/ProjectList.tsx`, `components/ProjectListCard.tsx`
new this session); `app/projects/index.tsx`, `app/projects/[id].tsx`,
`app/projects/unit/[unitTypeId].tsx`, `app/projects/campaign/[campaignId].tsx`,
`app/projects/booking/[bookingId].tsx`, `app/projects/bookings.tsx`.

- **`app/projects/bookings.tsx` ("My bookings") was not in the M0 route
  scaffold.** Screen #42 in the architecture plan's build order, added here
  since `bookingsEndpoints.mine` already existed with no screen calling it.
  Linked from the Profile tab, alongside a new "Projects" row — both reachable
  by any signed-in user, not owner-gated, since booking a unit is a buyer
  action.
- **There is no "am I already a member" endpoint for a group-buy campaign.**
  `join`, `exit` and `detail` are the only three calls; `detail` carries no
  per-user membership flag. `app/projects/campaign/[campaignId].tsx` therefore
  tracks join/exit only for what happens in the CURRENT session (component
  state, not persisted) and otherwise lets the backend's own 400
  ("already a member" / "not a member") surface as the error message rather
  than guessing membership client-side. A user who joined in an earlier
  session sees "Join" as the enabled button here, same as before joining —
  tapping it gets the backend's real answer.
- **Booking detail has no GET-by-id endpoint either.** `bookingsEndpoints` only
  has `mine` (list) and the two write routes, so
  `app/projects/booking/[bookingId].tsx` finds its booking in the
  `useMyBookings()` cache — populated already, since `useCreateBooking`
  invalidates that same query key on success and the booking sheet navigates
  straight here afterward.
- **Join/exit are declared with `rateLimit: 'groupBuy'`, but that limiter does
  not actually reach them.** Corrected 2026-08-09: `groupBuyLimiter` is mounted
  at `/api/group-buy/projects/:id/join|exit` (`backend/server.js:705-706`) and
  campaigns are mounted at `/api/campaigns` (`:880`). No `/api/group-buy` path
  exists, so join/exit are covered only by the 500-per-15-min global limiter.
  The campaign screen's handling of `ApiError.retryAfterSeconds` is still
  correct and worth keeping — it just fires on the global tier, far less often
  than the annotation implies.
- **Payment proof upload (campaign) and payment screenshot (booking) are two
  separate flows on two separate models**, not one shared component — a
  campaign's `paymentProof` field and a booking's `payment.screenshotUrl`
  are unrelated data on unrelated documents, even though both are "upload a
  payment screenshot" from a user's point of view.

### 2.13 Deep linking, offline, performance (M12, core pieces done)

`src/api/persistence.ts`, `src/lib/useNetworkStatus.ts`,
`src/ui/OfflineBanner.tsx`, `src/features/notifications/targets.ts` (extended).

- **Scheme-based deep linking (`dealdirect://property/123` etc.) needed no new
  code.** Expo Router resolves a URL against the file-based route tree
  automatically once `scheme` is set in `app.config.js` (already was, M0), so
  a cold start into a shared link lands directly on that screen without
  passing through `app/index.tsx`'s bootstrap gate at all.
- **Universal links (`https://dealdirect.in/property/123` opening the app
  instead of a browser) are NOT done, and nothing was added toward them this
  session.** That needs `ios.associatedDomains` / `android.intentFilters` in
  `app.config.js` AND a hosted `apple-app-site-association` file (requires the
  Apple Developer Team ID) plus `assetlinks.json` (requires the Android
  signing certificate's SHA-256 fingerprint) on the production web domain.
  Neither credential is available from this session, and a wrong or
  placeholder value in either file is actively worse than absent — it fails
  silently and is hard to debug later. Left undone rather than faked.
- **Query cache persistence** (`PersistQueryClientProvider` in
  `app/_layout.tsx`, backed by the `cacheStorage` MMKV instance M0 already
  provisioned) means a cold start with no connectivity still shows
  properties/projects/leads/rewards/etc. from the last successful fetch,
  capped at 24 hours old. **Chat is deliberately excluded** — see
  `shouldPersistQuery`'s doc comment: a socket-fed conversation shown as
  "current" after being disconnected for hours is a worse read than an empty
  state.
- **FlashList migration covers the genuinely long, unbounded lists**:
  property search results, the new projects list, leads, saved/interested,
  saved searches, and notifications. Chat's inverted thread list, the gallery
  carousel, and short bounded lists (sessions, my bookings) were left on
  `FlatList` — FlashList v2 (New Architecture only, which this app runs)
  buys nothing on a list capped at a handful of rows, and the chat thread's
  pagination/keyboard behaviour is already flagged untested on a device;
  changing its list implementation in the same pass it is unverified in was
  not worth the risk.
- **Offline is a banner, not a sync engine.** `OfflineBanner` (mounted once in
  `app/_layout.tsx`) tells the user before they tap something that a write
  will fail; the persisted query cache handles the read side; every write
  already produces the existing `network`-kind `ApiError` message
  ("No connection. Check your network and try again.", `src/api/errors.ts`).
  No offline write queue, no optimistic-then-reconcile beyond what individual
  features (like `useRemoveInterest`) already did on their own.
- **Not done: Sentry, a memoisation pass, and device performance
  verification.** No Sentry DSN is configured anywhere in this repo, so
  wiring the SDK now would be dead code with nowhere to report to — skipped
  rather than half-built. A repo-wide memoisation audit was judged lower
  value than the concrete items above and was not attempted. "Performance
  budgets met on a mid-range Android device" cannot be verified without a
  device, same as everything else this session.

### 2.14 Push notifications (M13, client-side/local done; server push still blocked)

`src/notifications/*` (new), `src/features/chat/activeConversation.ts` (new).

- **Read this before assuming more works than does.** `SocketProvider`
  disconnects the socket on background BY DESIGN (M6, for session-token
  reasons unrelated to push). That means the socket-driven local notification
  built here — a banner for a new chat message — can only ever fire while the
  app is in the FOREGROUND. There is no live connection to receive an event
  from otherwise. This is not a bug to fix later; it is the actual ceiling of
  what "push" can mean without the backend addition below.
- **True server-initiated push (notification arrives with the app closed) is
  UNCHANGED from the architecture plan's original finding: blocked.** No FCM/
  APNs device-token model, no push credentials, no registration route exist
  on this backend (`MOBILE_APP_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §0 finding #6). Nothing
  in this session added one, and nothing here pretends to — nowhere in the UI
  claims a notification will arrive while the app is closed or killed.
- **What was built:** a permission request (asked once ever, on first opening
  the Messages tab — not on launch — tracked in `prefsStorage` so it never
  re-prompts after the first answer either way), a foreground local
  notification for `receive_message` when the sender isn't you and the
  message isn't for the conversation currently open on screen (tracked via
  `setActiveConversationId`/`getActiveConversationId`, set by the chat thread
  screen on focus/blur), and tap-to-navigate back into that conversation.
- **`resolveNotificationTarget` (`features/notifications/targets.ts`) gained a
  `leads` target.** "New Interest on Your Property" notifications
  (`type: "interest"`, propertyController.js:1599) carry a `propertyId` but
  NO lead id — routing an owner to the public property page for their own
  listing was the wrong destination for this one type; it now routes to the
  leads list instead. This also means `resolveNotificationTarget` is now the
  one place both the notifications screen AND (if a future session adds a
  data-carrying local notification for something other than chat) any local
  tap handler would resolve a destination through — kept as one function
  rather than two.
- **`expo-notifications` is a THIRD new native module this session**, after
  `expo-image-picker`/`expo-image-manipulator` (M8). All three need the same
  dev-client rebuild — see the consolidated note in §5.1.

**Untested on a device, everything in this update (M7–M9, M11–M13).** This
pass verified with `tsc --noEmit`, `expo lint`, and
`expo export --platform android` only — no dev client was available to run
it. Beyond the M8 items already flagged: the group-buy join/exit rate-limit
messaging, the booking payment-screenshot round trip, query cache
rehydration on an actual cold start with no connectivity, and the entire
local-notification permission/foreground-banner/tap-routing chain all need
verification on a physical device before any of them are called solid.

## 3. Backend blockers found by measurement

These were all found by probing production, not by reading code. Every one is
recorded with evidence in the file that depends on it.

### 3.1 `listingType` filter is written but NOT DEPLOYED — highest priority

`backend/controllers/propertyController.js` correctly expands rent/sale across
all six schema spellings. Corrected 2026-08-09: it is **committed** (`ab5ec1b`,
"feat(search): honour listingType on /properties/search") but **not deployed** —
`main` is 4 commits ahead of `origin/main`, and deploy is a Hostinger git import
from `origin/main`. The conclusion is unchanged: the live API ignores the param,
and `?listingType=sale`, `Sell`, `rent` and `Rent` all return the same 36
results. Only the stated reason was stale.

**Effect:** the Buy and Rent buttons — the primary CTA — open unfiltered results.
Home is correct because `useCollection` and the rails guard intent client-side;
the browse screen is not.

**Fix:** deploy the existing change. No new code.

### 3.2 There is no PRIVATE save — corrected 2026-08-05

**The earlier version of this section was wrong** and said no endpoint could add
to the saved list. Read `getSavedProperties` (propertyController.js:1726): it
queries `{ "interestedUsers.user": userId }` — the same array `markInterested`
pushes to. **Saved and interested are one list under two names.**
`DELETE /saved/:id` and `DELETE /interested/:id` are the same operation written
twice.

So the write path exists: `POST /properties/interested/:id`. What does not exist
is a *private* one. Adding to this list creates a `Lead`, emails the owner, and
hands over the user's name, email and phone. The backend also caps it at **five
listings per user**, rejecting the sixth with a 400.

**Effect:** no heart icon, for a different reason than previously recorded. A
heart means private, free, unlimited and quietly undoable, and this action is
none of those. M4 ships it as a labelled button with a consequence line
(`DetailActions.tsx`). Undo works, but does not unsend the notification or
delete the lead.

**Still worth a backend change request** if a genuine private bookmark is
wanted, since the current list cannot serve both purposes. M5's saved tab is
NOT blocked: it can render this list today.

### 3.3 No `sort=views`

`/properties/search` accepts `newest`, `priceAsc`, `priceDesc` only. `views` is
real data with a real spread (166 down to 5 across 36 listings) and is now
carried on `PropertySummary`.

**Current workaround:** `usePopularListings` fetches one page of 100 and sorts
locally. Exact today; degrades to "most viewed among the newest 100" later, and
the section subtitle changes itself to say so.

**Fix:** one line in the controller's sort map. Collapses that whole file into an
ordinary query.

### 3.4 Taxonomy refs are corrupt (known since M3)

`category` / `subcategory` / `propertyType` are null on 15 of 36 listings and
point at the wrong document on the other 21. The app therefore ships **no
category or property-type filter** and uses free-text terms instead.

**Fix:** backfill from the correct `categoryName` / `propertyTypeName` columns.
Makes all three filters work with zero client change.

### 3.5 `address.city` is not normalised on write

Live values include `Bangalore` (9) and `Bengaluru` (6) for one city, `Kolkata`
and `kolkata`, `Howrah ` with a trailing space, and `Ahamdabad`.

**Current workaround:** `cities.ts` carries an alias table and merges them
client-side, which is the only place the join can happen (the `city` param is
exact and case-sensitive; `search` is escaped server-side so no alternation gets
through).

---

## 4. Recommended order for core logic

M4 through M9 and M11 through M13 are done (§2.5–§2.14), except the
property-detail map (held for a dev-client rebuild, §5.1) and true
server-initiated push (blocked on a backend change request, §2.14). **M10
(agreements) was explicitly skipped this session** and is the one gap left in
the M4–M13 range. What's left, in order:

1. **M10 — agreements.** Depends on M8 (done). The largest remaining
   buyer/owner-facing gap.
2. **The map phase**, whenever a dev-client rebuild is scheduled: property
   detail's locator (§2.5) plus M8's add/edit picker, both against
   `docs/MAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
3. **The universal-links half of M12** (§2.13) — needs the Apple Team ID and
   the Android signing cert's SHA-256 fingerprint, neither available from a
   coding session; someone with access to both has to produce
   `apple-app-site-association` and `assetlinks.json` and this app's
   `associatedDomains`/`intentFilters` config together.
4. **M14** — store readiness, once everything above is settled.

---

## 5. Decisions a new session must not accidentally undo

### 5.1 No new native modules without a very good reason

I added `expo-linear-gradient`, then removed it and rebuilt gradients on RN's
built-in `experimental_backgroundImage` (`src/ui/Gradient.tsx`). Reason: a native
module invalidates every installed dev client, and `expo start --tunnel` ships
**JavaScript only**, so it silently serves a bundle the installed binary cannot
run. Chirag's device workflow depends on this. Native additions must be
deliberate and announced.

**M8 added two more, deliberately: `expo-image-picker` and
`expo-image-manipulator`.** There was no way to build listing photo upload
without a native picker, and no way to keep uploads under the backend's 10 MB
per-file cap without client-side compression. Both are registered in
`app.config.js`'s `plugins` array.

**M12 added `@react-native-community/netinfo`** for the offline banner
(§2.13) — connectivity state needs a listener-based API, which `expo-network`
does not provide.

**M13 added `expo-notifications`**, for the local-notification permission and
presentation calls (§2.14). No push-credential config needed on the client
side for what this milestone actually built (local only), but the module
itself is still native.

**This means the installed dev client is now stale for FOUR independent
reasons**: the M4 map's `react-native-webview`/`expo-location`, M8's
`expo-image-picker`/`expo-image-manipulator`, M12's
`@react-native-community/netinfo`, and M13's `expo-notifications`. One
rebuild covers all four — do them together, not one at a time.

### 5.2 The 20-req/min search limiter is a real design constraint

`/properties/search`, `/suggestions` and `/filter` are capped at **20 requests
per minute per IP**, and on Indian mobile networks that IP is a carrier NAT
gateway shared with strangers. This is why:

- Home sections below the fold are wrapped in `Reveal` (`src/lib/scrollReveal.tsx`),
  which withholds the **mount**, and therefore the query, until the section
  approaches the viewport.
- Collections cache for 10 minutes, city counts for 15.
- City counts come from **one** request counted locally, not 12 requests.

Do not add an eager query to Home.

### 5.3 One browsing implementation

Home owns no feed, no filters, no sort, no pagination. Every affordance does
`router.push({ pathname: '/search', params })`. A rent feed, a sale feed and a
search-results screen are the same screen three times and they drift.

### 5.4 Nothing claims what the data cannot support

No fabricated stats. The ported production home screen carried "₹50 Cr+
Brokerage Saved", "10k+ Happy Families" and city tiles reading "Mumbai 5000+"
against a live corpus of **36 listings**, where Mumbai has 9. All of it is gone
or computed. "Popular Listings" is real view counts; city tiles are real counts;
"Featured" was renamed because no curation flag exists.

Related: a section with no data **unmounts** rather than rendering an empty
state. See `CollectionRail`.

### 5.5 Live corpus is small — verify before assuming

36 approved properties, 5 builder projects. 25 of 36 properties have real
`address.latitude`/`longitude`. Probe endpoints before building against assumed
volume; several "obvious" features return zero rows.

---

## 6. Verification commands

```bash
cd dealdirect-mobile
npx tsc --noEmit          # currently clean
npx expo lint             # currently 0 errors, 11 pre-existing warnings
npx expo export --platform android   # currently succeeds
```

Device: `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081` then
`npx expo start --dev-client --localhost`. `--tunnel` is currently broken
because `@expo/ngrok@4.1.3` bundles an ngrok v2-era agent that ngrok has
retired server-side; there is no newer version.

---

## 7. UI work deliberately deferred

Chirag's call, 2026-08-05: core logic first, UI later. Outstanding UI items,
none of them blocking:

- Hero artwork is unresolved. Four images tried; current one is the website's
  `herokaback.png` (Dubai, 2752×1085 panorama, ~40% visible after crop).
- The **photo-band hero** was proposed and not built: photo in a ~260pt band
  fading into solid dark, with the search and buttons on the solid part. Removes
  the scrim entirely, shows ~78% of any image, and means the scrim never needs
  retuning per image. This is the right fix and it is still open.
- Collections rails are built but not rendered (§2.8).
- `assets/home/brand/hero.png` (558 KB) is unused; delete or use.

---

## 8. M15–M22 — feature-parity scope (2026-08-08, M15–M17 done same day)

A direct file-by-file audit of `client-next/` against `dealdirect-mobile/`
turned up features the website ships that mobile doesn't. Chirag reviewed the
full list and selected what to build next. **M15, M16 and M17 were
implemented in the same session that wrote this scope** — see the "Done"
notes under each below for what actually shipped and where it diverged from
the scope as first written. M18–M22 remain scope only, no code yet. Two items
were surfaced and explicitly declined; they're listed at the end so a future
session doesn't "rediscover" and re-propose them.

> ### COMPULSORY — the backend is live in production. Do not touch it.
>
> `backend/` is running in production today, serving the website and the
> admin panel as well as this app. Every feature in M15–M22 below is
> **frontend-only, mobile-side work** — proven by the fact that the website
> already renders all of it against this exact same backend, unchanged. If
> M15–M22 ever seems to need a new route, a new field, a schema change, or
> any edit under `backend/`, that is a signal the scope was misread, not a
> green light to add one. Stop and re-check against the website's own
> implementation before writing a single line of backend code.
>
> This extends `MOBILE_APP_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §7 ("Things that MUST NEVER
> be changed", rules 1–15) to the whole of M15–M22, with no exceptions listed
> here — unlike M13's push-notification change request, nothing in this
> range has been pre-approved for a backend change. Specifically, for the
> items below:
>
> - **Close Deal + Claim Reward, brochure/RERA links, video/nearby fields,
>   reward tiers** — all already returned by the live API today (the website
>   reads `wallet.tier`, `project.media.brochureUrl`, `property.videoUrl`,
>   `property.nearby`, and calls the close-deal endpoint against this same
>   backend right now). Mobile is missing the client code, not the data.
> - **Advanced search filters** — the underlying city/category/type data
>   quality problem (§3.4, §3.5) is a known, pre-existing backend condition.
>   Build the filters to tolerate it the way the website does. Do not "fix"
>   the taxonomy or city normalisation in `backend/` to make the filters
>   behave better — that is a backend change, and it is out of scope here
>   regardless of how small it looks.
> - **Content pages (M20)** — confirm each page's copy/data source (static
>   copy, or an existing `GET /api/blogs`-style endpoint already used by the
>   website) before assuming a new backend endpoint is needed. It isn't; the
>   website is already fetching this content from something that exists.
>
> If a future session genuinely believes a backend change is required for
> anything in M15–M22, that is a decision for Chirag to make explicitly, the
> same way M13's push-notification change request was raised and approved on
> its own merits before any code was written — not something to decide and
> proceed on mid-implementation.

| Milestone | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| M15 | Advanced search filters + profile depth | **done** |
| M16 | Property detail completion (map, video, nearby, EMI, compare, related) | **done except the locator map** — still blocked, §5.1 |
| M17 | Owner transaction completion (close deal, photo categorisation, location picker) | **done except the location picker** — still blocked, §5.1 |
| M18 | Rewards depth (tiers, terms page) | not started |
| M19 | Project extras (brochure, RERA download) | not started |
| M20 | Content & marketing pages (blog, about, why-us, faq, contact, press, privacy, terms) | not started |
| M21 | Platform polish (collections rails, Sentry) | not started |
| M22 | Store readiness | not started (this **is** the original plan's M14, reactivated) |

**Verification for M15–M17:** `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx expo lint` both
clean — 0 errors, the same 11 pre-existing warnings §6 already documents,
nothing new added. **Untested on a device or in Expo Go/dev-client**, same
caveat every prior milestone in this document carries: this pass verified
with the type checker and linter only.

**Order followed:** M15 and M16 depended only on existing data layers and
were pure mobile-side work, so they went first, as planned. M17's close-deal
piece shipped the same way; its photo-categorisation piece turned out to
share nothing with the map's native-module dependency (§5.1) and shipped
too — only the location picker itself stayed blocked, alongside M16's
locator map, both on the same pending dev-client rebuild. **Remaining order,
unchanged from the original plan:** M18/M19 are additive, no shared
dependency, can run in any order or in parallel. M20 is entirely new route
scaffolding, zero overlap with anything else — safe to parallelise. M21's
Sentry item needs a DSN from Chirag before it can start; the collections-rails
item is a few minutes of work (already built, just needs mounting, §2.8).
**M22 last**, once everything above is settled — matches the original plan's
own ordering logic (§4).

### M15 — Advanced search filters + profile depth (done)

**Done 2026-08-08.** Both pieces shipped; the search filters piece resolved
the "which trade-off" question this section originally left open, rather than
picking one blindly:

- **Search filters — resolved by filtering client-side over an already-fetched
  page, not by fixing the backend or accepting broken results.**
  `usePopularListings`'s existing pattern (fetch one bounded page from
  `/properties/search`, `limit=100`, then work over rows already in hand) is
  reused wholesale: `usePropertySearchFeed` (`features/search/hooks.ts`)
  switches into that mode only when a city/category/furnishing/construction
  filter is active, and delegates to the untouched, unchanged
  `usePropertyFeed` infinite-scroll path otherwise. Category and city filters
  are genuinely safe now — `categoryName` and `matchCity`'s alias table (the
  same one `features/home/cities.ts` already built) are both correct data,
  the earlier write-up's concern was only ever about the corrupt `category`/
  `propertyType` **ObjectId refs**, which this never touches. Furnishing
  turned out to be a real, closed-enum field (`Property.furnishing`) the
  website's OWN filter doesn't even read correctly (it checks a
  `furnishingStatus` field that doesn't exist in the schema at all) — mobile's
  version is the first one that actually works. Construction status is
  genuinely free text with no enum, so it's a best-effort keyword match
  (`ready` / `construction`), documented as such in `filters.ts` rather than
  presented as exact. "Posted by" (owners vs. partner agents) was dropped —
  no backing field exists on the schema for it; it appears to be decorative
  UI on the website with nothing behind it. Full reasoning:
  `src/features/search/filters.ts`'s updated header comment.
- **Rich profile fields — shipped exactly as scoped.** All five fields plus
  the SMS toggle are now in `UpdateProfileValues`, the settings form
  (`app/settings/index.tsx`), and the multipart payload, matching the field
  names `userController.js:922` already reads
  (`alternatePhone`, `address` as a JSON object, `dateOfBirth`, `gender`,
  `preferences.smsNotifications`). Date of birth is a `YYYY-MM-DD` text field
  rather than a native date picker — no date-picker module is installed, and
  adding one is its own native-module decision (§5.1), not a default this
  form should force.

*Original scope write-up below, kept for the reasoning it recorded before
implementation started — the "Done" note above is what actually shipped.*

- **Search filters.** Website (`client-next/src/app/properties/PropertyListContent.jsx`
  filter bar, `client-next/src/components/HeroSection/*Filter.jsx`,
  `filterConfig.js`) exposes city, property type (category-scoped
  residential/commercial sub-types), 33-tier budget bands, possession status
  (ready-to-move / under-construction), furnishing (furnished / semi /
  unfurnished / gated community), and posted-by (owners / partner agents).
  Mobile's `src/features/search/filters.ts` + `FilterSheet.tsx` deliberately
  ship only free text, rent/sale, a 5-tier price band, and sort — the file's
  own header comment explains why (city/type/category data is unreliable
  against live production data, §3.4/§3.5 of this document). Building this
  means either accepting that unreliability the same way the website does, or
  fixing the underlying taxonomy/city-normalisation issues first. Decide
  which before starting — do not silently re-introduce the bug the current
  code was written to avoid.
- **Rich profile fields.** Website (`client-next/src/app/profile/ProfileContent.jsx`,
  Profile Info tab) collects alternate phone, date of birth, gender, and a
  5-field address block (line1, line2, city, state, pincode), plus separate
  email and SMS notification toggles. Mobile's `useUpdateProfile`
  (`src/features/profile/hooks.ts`) and its form on `app/settings/index.tsx`
  send only `name`, `phone`, `bio`, `emailNotifications`, and photo — the
  other fields aren't in the payload builder at all, not even as unused UI.
  Add the fields to `UpdateProfileValues`, the form, and the multipart
  payload; confirm the backend's `updateProfile`
  (`userController.js:922`) actually persists all of them before trusting the
  UI.

### M16 — Property detail completion (done except the locator map)

**Done 2026-08-08**, except the locator map, which stays blocked exactly as
scoped — nothing changed there:

- **Video walkthrough + Nearby chips** shipped as pure render-layer additions,
  as scoped — `VideoWalkthrough.tsx` and `NearbyPlaces.tsx`
  (`features/properties/components/`), wired into
  `app/property/[id]/index.tsx`. Video opens externally via `Linking.openURL`
  rather than an embedded YouTube iframe — embedding needs a WebView, which is
  the exact native module the locator map is blocked on (§5.1); adding it for
  this smaller feature would trigger the same dev-client rebuild for a much
  smaller payoff. `PropertyDetail.nearby` and `PropertySummary.furnishing`/
  `.constructionStatus` were added to `features/properties/types.ts` and
  `adapters.ts` to carry the fields these needed — the same two fields M15's
  filters also ended up needing, so they only had to be added once.
- **EMI calculator** shipped as scoped, arithmetic ported 1:1 from the
  website's `useEffect` in `PropertyDetailsContent.jsx` (`EmiCalculator.tsx`).
- **Compare properties** shipped, but comparing `PropertySummary` fields
  (already in memory from the search results being browsed), never
  `PropertyDetail` — seeing `GET /properties/:id` increments the listing's
  view counter on every call, fetching 2–3 listings' full detail just to
  populate a comparison table would have silently inflated their view counts
  for an action that isn't a real view. The row set is correspondingly
  smaller than the website's (no amenities/parking/facing — those live only
  on `PropertyDetail.raw`). `features/search/compare.ts` has the full
  reasoning. UI: `CompareBar.tsx` (sticky selection bar) and
  `CompareSheet.tsx` (side-by-side table), both in
  `features/search/components/`; `PropertyCard` gained an optional `compare`
  prop so every other screen that renders one is unaffected.
- **Related properties** shipped, scored against a bounded 100-listing pool
  (`RELATED_POOL_SIZE` in `features/search/related.ts`) rather than the
  website's unbounded `/property-list` fetch — same reasoning as M15's filter
  pool. Shown as a footer rail (`PropertyList` gained an optional `footer`
  prop) below search results once the direct match count drops under 6.

*Original scope write-up below, kept for the reasoning it recorded before
implementation started.*

- **Locator map.** `app/property/[id]/map.tsx` is currently an 11-line
  `Placeholder` stub. Needs the dev-client rebuild (§5.1) for
  `react-native-webview` + `expo-location`. Full spec already exists at
  `docs/MAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- **Video walkthrough embed.** `videoUrl` is already typed and adapted
  (`src/features/properties/types.ts:149`, `adapters.ts:335`) but never
  rendered anywhere. Website renders it via `getVideoEmbedUrl` as a YouTube
  iframe / external-link fallback (`PropertyDetailsContent.jsx`). Pure
  render-layer work — no new data plumbing needed.
- **Nearby places chips.** Same situation: `nearby`/`nearbyPlaces`
  (`src/types/backend/property.ts:57`) is typed, never rendered. Website
  shows it as chips near the amenities section. Also pure render-layer work.
- **EMI / loan calculator.** New UI + arithmetic, no backend dependency.
  Website version (`PropertyDetailsContent.jsx`, state ~L567–753, UI
  ~L1398–1409): editable loan amount (defaults to 80% of listing price),
  interest rate, tenure → live monthly EMI. No shared dependency with the
  map — build it independently of the M17 native-module rebuild.
- **Compare properties.** Largest of this group. Website
  (`PropertyListContent.jsx` L310–539, L2221–2521): pick up to 3 same-type
  listings, sticky compare bar, side-by-side spec modal. Needs new
  cross-screen state (selection persists while browsing search results) —
  design that before writing UI.
- **Related/similar properties.** Website backfills a scored "related
  properties" grid when a filtered search returns under 6 results
  (`PropertyListContent.jsx` L901–1021, L2039–2076). Port the same scoring
  logic; verify it still makes sense against the live 36-listing corpus
  (§5.5) before assuming it'll ever have enough data to show anything.

### M17 — Owner transaction completion (done except the location picker)

**Done 2026-08-08**, except the location picker, which stays blocked exactly
as scoped — same native-module dependency as M16's locator map, nothing
changed there:

- **Close Deal + Claim Reward** shipped end to end, including a gap the
  original scope note didn't catch: `claimDealReward` has no "my
  verifications" list to be reached from, and the `deal_reward` notification
  that announces an approved deal carries a `verificationId`, not a
  `propertyId` — `resolveNotificationTarget`
  (`features/notifications/targets.ts`) had no case for that type, so the
  notification was previously unnavigable, dead in the list. Added a
  `dealReward` target and a new route,
  `app/claim-reward/[verificationId].tsx`, which claims automatically on open
  (the notification tap was already the confirmation step) and handles
  `alreadyClaimed: true` as the normal repeat-tap outcome it is, not an error.
  Close-deal itself is `CloseDealSheet.tsx`
  (`features/listings/components/`), opened from a new "Close deal" button on
  `app/owner/properties.tsx`, gated on the exact same status set the backend
  itself rejects (`pending_verification`/`sold`/`rented`) so the button never
  offers an action the server would 400. Proof documents are photos via
  `expo-image-picker` (already installed since M8), not arbitrary PDF upload —
  adding `expo-document-picker` for this one screen would be a fourth native
  module stacked on the pending rebuild for a feature photographing the same
  paperwork already serves. `CloseDealResponse`/`ClaimDealRewardResponse` were
  added to `types/backend/property.ts`, replacing the placeholder `OkEnvelope`
  typing on both endpoints — the real payloads carry `verification`/`reward`
  objects the UI actually needs.
- **Per-room categorised photo upload** shipped, and turned out to need
  matching two DIFFERENT wire formats, not one — `addProperty` and
  `updateMyProperty` disagree on both the file field name for new categorised
  photos (`categorizedImages` vs `images`) AND the shape of
  `imageCategoryMap` (an object keyed by category vs. a position-matched
  array) — see the expanded module doc in `features/listings/formData.ts`
  for the exact mechanics, confirmed by reading both controller functions
  directly rather than assuming they matched. `existingCategorizedPhotos`
  (`editAdapter.ts`, replacing the old flatten-everything-to-`other`
  `existingPhotoUrls`) now preserves each existing photo's real category
  through an edit, rather than silently re-bucketing the whole gallery into
  `other` the way the pre-M17 code did. `ListingForm.tsx` gained a
  per-tile "which room is this?" sheet, category options scoped to
  Residential/Commercial via `photoCategoriesFor` (`features/listings/types.ts`).
- **Location picker**: unchanged, still blocked. `react-native-webview` and
  `expo-location` are still not in `package.json` — checked again at the
  start of this work, not assumed from the earlier note.

*Original scope write-up below, kept for the reasoning it recorded before
implementation started.*

- **Close Deal + Claim Reward.** The single biggest functional hole in owner
  mode. `POST` endpoint is already typed in
  `src/api/endpoints/properties.ts` but nothing calls it. Website's
  `components/Properties/CloseDealModal.jsx` is the reference: owner picks
  closing type (sold/rented, defaulted from listing type), uploads closing
  documents, selects the buyer from `interestedUsers`, submits. This is what
  triggers the reward payout — until this exists, an owner on mobile has no
  way to ever claim a reward.
- **Add/edit property location picker.** Not built at all today (distinct
  from the detail-page locator map above). Shares the same native-module
  dependency (§5.1).
- **Per-room categorised photo upload.** Website buckets photos into
  `categorizedImages.residential.kitchen` / `.bedroom` / etc. Mobile
  (`src/features/listings/formData.ts`) only offers one flat `other` bucket
  today — deliberately descoped in M8, not a technical blocker. Re-read
  `buildEditFormData`'s reasoning (§2.10) before touching this: the edit-flow
  image landmine (omitting `existingCategorizedImages` wipes the gallery) is
  still real and must stay handled once per-room UI is added.

### M18 — Rewards depth

- **Reward tiers.** Website (`client-next/src/app/rewards/dashboard/RewardsDashboardContent.jsx`,
  `TIER_CONFIG`) has Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond. Mobile's
  `app/rewards/index.tsx` shows balance + referral link + store/redeem only
  (already built, §2.9) — no tier system.
- **Rewards Terms page.** Website has a dedicated 127-line subpage
  (`client-next/src/app/rewards/terms/RewardsTermsContent.jsx`). New mobile
  route, static content, no data layer needed.

### M19 — Project extras

- **Brochure + RERA certificate download.** Website
  (`client-next/src/app/projects/[id]/ProjectDetailContent.jsx` L319–324,
  `.../units/[unitTypeId]/UnitDetailContent.jsx` L362–368) links
  `project.media.brochureUrl` and a RERA cert URL. Mobile's project/unit type
  layer doesn't carry these fields yet — add to `types.ts`/`adapters.ts` in
  `src/features/projects/` before the screens can render them.

### M20 — Content & marketing pages

None of these exist in mobile as routes today — no stubs, nothing. All are
static-to-mostly-static content, low risk, no shared state with the rest of
the app. Website sources:

| Page | Website route |
|---|---|
| Blog list + post | `client-next/src/app/blog/`, `blog/[slug]/` |
| About | `client-next/src/app/about/` |
| Why DealDirect | `client-next/src/app/why-us/` |
| FAQ | `client-next/src/app/faq/` |
| Contact / Support | `client-next/src/app/contact/` |
| Press & Impressions | `client-next/src/app/press-impressions/` |
| Privacy Policy | `client-next/src/app/privacy/` |
| Terms of Service | `client-next/src/app/terms/` |

Matches screens #43–44 in the original architecture plan's screen order
(§4 of that document), which anticipated blog/contact but not the other six —
those are new scope from the 2026-08-08 audit.

### M21 — Platform polish

- **Enable collections rails.** Already built and tested
  (`src/features/home/collections.ts`, `CollectionRail.tsx`) — 15 curated
  rails (Luxury, Sea View, Starter Homes, …), each gated on live result count.
  Not currently mounted on Home. One `COLLECTIONS.map()` call away (§2.8).
  Do this first in this milestone — it's minutes of work, not days.
- **Sentry.** Website has it wired; mobile has no DSN configured anywhere.
  Blocked on Chirag supplying a DSN — flag this rather than guessing one.

### M22 — Store readiness

This is the original plan's **M14**, reactivated rather than redefined. See
`MOBILE_APP_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` §M14 and §1.27–1.28 for the App Store /
Play Store requirements already documented there. Sequence last, once M15–M21
are settled — a store listing for a half-finished feature set is wasted
effort.

### Explicitly declined — do not re-propose

Two items came up in the audit and Chirag turned them down. Don't rebuild
them without asking again:

- **WhatsApp contact/share buttons** — website has them on project/unit
  detail, my-properties, and blog (`wa.me` links). Declined for mobile.
- **Newsletter signup** — website's footer version is itself a non-functional
  stub (`Footer.jsx`, `handleSubscribe` just simulates success via
  `setTimeout`, no real API call). Not worth porting a fake feature.

**Agreements (M10 of the original plan) remains skipped**, unchanged from
§1's status table — the audit surfaced it again as the single largest
remaining gap, and Chirag declined to schedule it in this pass. It stays the
biggest open item in the whole roadmap; revisit as its own decision, not
folded into M15–M22.
